🚀 **[Use the Calculator Online](https://yourusername.github.io/pintle-injector-calculator)** 🚀

A web-based engineering tool for rocket engine pintle injector design and analysis. No downloads required - runs directly in your browser.

## What is a Pintle Injector?

Pintle injectors are specialized components in liquid rocket engines that control how fuel and oxidizer mix together. They use a central "pintle" (spike) surrounded by holes that spray propellants in precise patterns to optimize combustion efficiency.

## What This Calculator Does

This tool helps rocket engineers design and analyze pintle injector configurations by calculating:

- **🔧 Injector Geometry**: Hole sizes, patterns, and spacing for optimal flow
- **📊 Performance Analysis**: Flow rates, velocities, and mixing characteristics  
- **⚖️ Design Trade-offs**: Compare fuel-internal vs oxidizer-internal configurations
- **🎯 Optimization**: Find the best configuration for your specific requirements

## Key Features

- **No Installation Required**: Works directly in any web browser
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Calculates 11+ engineering parameters
- **Dual Configurations**: Supports both fuel-internal and oxidizer-internal designs
- **High Accuracy**: Choose between fast approximations (±1%) or reference-quality data (±0.1%)
- **Interactive Results**: Filter and analyze results with easy-to-use tables
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
